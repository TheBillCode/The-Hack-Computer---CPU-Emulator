# The-Hack-Computer---CPU-Emulator
This repository is for code written for the Hack Computer (https://www.nand2tetris.org/software) including the assembler code and RAM scripts.

The two morse files "morse.asm" and "morse.tst" work together to turn keyboard input into morse code symbols.

The two files "imageTest.asm" and "imageTest.tst" work together to produce an image on the emulator screen.
